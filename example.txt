This is to test init from local and connect to the remote repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
# Rename the branch (default "master") to "main"
git branch -M main
#git remote add <<Git Remote Repo local Name>> <<Git Remote Repo URL>>
git remote add origin https://github.com/Nithi-Github/local-remote-repo.git
#git push -u <<Git Remote Repo local Name>> <<Git local repo Branch to be pushed>>
git push -u origin main

#To check the current name of your remote use the command
git remote -v
#TO rename the local remote ref name

# To change the Remote Repo that "origin" is pointing to
git remote set-url <remote_name> <new_url>
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Nithi-Github/new-local-remote-repo.git

#To switch to Feature Branch in remote locally
git checkout master #move to master branch
git pull #Upates the changes in the master Branch
git checkout <<Remote Branch Name>> creates a local Branch with same name as Remote Branch
git checkout -b <<New Branch Naeme>> <<origin/Remote Branch Name>>
 
#Import Points
